# CRMProject

This is the very first project I made for my college assignment. Had to use JSP 'cause college didn't allow to use Django. This project still have lots of loose ends which is gonna stay that way unfortunately.  


**To run this project you need-**  
1. jdk jre - 6 (what I used).  
2. tomcat v8.5 (what I used)   (change the very first port number in server.xml to 8081.).
3. oracleXE 10g (I'll upload the software in my repository).  
4. jar files, namely-  (already in the project)  
     >> activation.jar  
     >> mail.jar  
     >> ojdbc14.jar  
     >> ojdbc14_g.jar  
5. I used Eclipse IDE for this project.
